# Help file of .xlsx
".xlsx" is a file that includes species-specific parameters at different scales (20 m and 10 m) and different intervals.

Column meanings:

The first column contains species abbreviation names.
The second column (beta0) represents the species-specific intercept.
Columns three to ten represents the species-specific response to environmental variables.
Columns 11 to 14 represents the species-specific response to latent variables.
The last column represents the species-specific dispersion of recruitment.
Worksheet names:

The worksheet names include fs2.20, fs3.20, fs4.20, fsall.20, fs2.10, fs3.10, fs4.10, and fsall.10.
The first four and the last four worksheets represent the 20 m and 10 m scales, respectively.
fs2, fs3, fs4, and fsall indicate the first, second, third, and full intervals, respectively.

Values represent medians of posterior distribution, while values in the brackets are upper and lower bounds of 95% credible intervals (CI).

All parameter estimates are presented in the link scale.
